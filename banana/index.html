        <h1>Banana</h1>
        <p>The banana is an elongated, curved fruit with a thick outer peel and soft, sweet inner flesh. Bananas grow in clusters on tall plants that are botanically classified as an herb but have a tree-like structure. Most modern edible bananas come from two wild species - Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.</p>
        <p>Bananas are a rich source of fiber, potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C and various antioxidants. They are commonly eaten raw when ripe but can also be used in cooking and baking. The most common type is the Cavendish banana, which has a sweet flavor and creamy texture.</p>
