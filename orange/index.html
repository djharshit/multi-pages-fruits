        <h1>Orange</h1>
        <p>Oranges are a round, citrus fruit with a tough outer rind and juicy, segmented pulp inside. They primarily originated in Southeast Asia but are now grown in warm regions around the world. There are several species of the orange plant, with the most common being Citrus x sinensis.</p>
        <p>Oranges are an excellent source of vitamin C and also contain vitamin A, calcium, potassium and dietary fiber. They can be eaten fresh by peeling away the rind, or used to make juice, marmalades and other foods. Popular varieties include navel oranges, Valencia oranges and blood oranges.</p>
