        <h1>About Fruits</h1>
        <p>
            Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. 
            Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact, 
            humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.
            They are the main source of sustenance for human and animals. 
            Fruits are also used for gift giving, e.g., in the form of Fruit Baskets and Fruit Bouquets.
            They are also used in manufactured foods like cookies, cakes, ice cream, yogurt, and many more. 
            Many fruits are used to make beverages, such as fruit juices (orange juice, apple juice, grape juice, etc) or alcoholic beverages, such as wine or brandy.
